# Tetris

This is a tetris implementation in js, based on this [tutorial from Michael Karen, on Medium](https://michael-karen.medium.com/learning-modern-javascript-with-tetris-92d532bcd057), with full [git implementation of that tutorial here](https://github.com/melcor76/js-tetris). It's an exploration of the syntax, and language, to set up my understanding or future endeavours (tetreggle).
